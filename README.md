## Hi, I'm vivzio!

You can call me **Vivienne**, **Vi**, **Viv**, or just plain ol' **vivzio**.

I'm a 15 year old trans girl (she/they), who takes an interest in programming and creating music.

I'm starting to expand my knowledge about different programming languages. I'm currently in the process of learning C#, then I plan to refocus on the more advanced stuff with HTML + CSS. I know a decent amount about Python, basic Lua, and *very* little JavaScript.

The most notable project of mine is the "Meowl" Discord bot. I worked on that for a couple months, but I'm currently taking a pause on developing that to work on some other things and focus on some personal stuff.

If you wanna work on a Python project together (I'm best at Roblox macros and Discord bots), I'd be glad to! If you want to contact me, you can reach me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/literallyvivzio) or [Discord (@vivzio)](https://discord.com/users/1372365589082935456)!
